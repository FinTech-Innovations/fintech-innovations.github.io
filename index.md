# About the Lab

Welcome to the FinTech Lab @ LSU!

This lab is a cloud-based, modern laboratory environment for the study of technological innovations in the finance industry.

The lab was designed by [Dr. James Nordlund](https://nordlund.ai) and [Dr. Dimuthu Ratnadiwakara](https://sites.google.com/view/dimuthu-ratnadiwakara).  These two professors serve as co-admins of the lab.

# Accessing the Lab

Students and faculty must access the lab either from a computer on-campus or from an off-campus computer that is connected to LSU's [virtual private network](https://networking.grok.lsu.edu/Browse.aspx?searchString=&searchDomain=Current&parentCategoryId=3682).

# The "What" and "Why" of FinTech

We define FinTech as the implementation of new technology with the intent to improve the efficiency or performance of financial products or services.

There are myriad examples of the usefulness of modern technology in finance.  Consider the disclosure of risk factors in a firm's annual report.  Finance is about the study of risk and return, after all!  In 2019, a total of 52 *million* words were used by companies in their risk disclosure.  To read over all of these disclosures within the span of one year, a human would need to read the equivalent of all seven Harry Potter books *each and every week*.  A computer, in contrast, can read an analyze the totality of these disclosures in a matter of minutes!   Exctracting information from these disclosures is thus best left to the machines.
