# About the IL Lab

Coming Q4 2021, the **Interactive Learning Lab** (IL Lab) is a network of classrooms, seminar rooms, and meeting rooms for collaborative learning.  Technological assets for the IL Lab are generously supported by a LSU Student Tech Fee grant awarded to Dr. Nordlund.  IL Lab spaces encourage interactive, peer-based learning and socratic instruction.  More details about the IL Lab will be made available at a later date.
