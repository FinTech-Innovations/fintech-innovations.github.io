<p>The CloudLab is a digital teaching environment that provides students with access to cutting-edge technologies that are used in modern finance.  The alpha version of the CloudLab piggybacked on extant cloud technologies.  FinTech courses utilized AWS, Azure, CoCalc, and RStudio Cloud.</p>

<p>An in-house cloud environment was developed for enhanced educational opportunities within FinTech courses.  This lab was generously supported by a LSU Student Tech Fee grant awarded to Drs. Nordlund and Ratnadiwakara.  Students and faculty may access the lab either from a computer on-campus or from an off-campus computer that is connected to LSUâ€™s <a href="https://networking.grok.lsu.edu/Browse.aspx?searchString=&amp;searchDomain=Current&amp;parentCategoryId=3682">virtual private network</a>.  The lab currently hosts RStudio Server as well as a Jupyter Lab environment.  Students apply principles of data science and data analytics to study real-world financial data.</p>
